## Getting Started

The app has been prebuilt and is accessible inside the `build` folder.
Just open `build/index.html` and you should be good to go.

## Supported Browsers

This app has been tested on the latest Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers on macOS Mojave (10.14.2). 

##Â Dependencies

If you want to run this project locally and develop it, you will need Node, NPM and optionally Yarn.
All the commands shown in this README use `yarn`, so it is recommended you use that package manager,
but you can execute equivalent commands using `npm`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode
and optimizes the build for the best performance.
