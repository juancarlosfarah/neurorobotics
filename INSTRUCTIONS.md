# Instructions

## Summary
In this folder, you will find an XML file, describing so-called experiment templates for the
Neurorobotics platform and a folder with thumbnail images, one for each experiment.

In the Neurorobotics Platform, templates are the starting points for new experiments.

## Task

Your task consists in implementing a web page with the following properties:

1. Display the available experiments (with their thumbnails).
2. Help users organize the experiment list according to custom, or generic criteria.
3. Select an experiment to be copied (cloned) into the user's workspace.
4. The page should run on standard browsers like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox and should not depend on OS specific extensions (such as activex).

Please implement the challenge according to your taste with a focus on ease of use and clarity.
You should not spend more than 5 hours on the challenge. You are free to provide advanced
functionality/design proposals as mockups.

## Submission

Your solution should be submitted via email as a zipped folder to luc.guyot@epfl.ch.
Please mention that you are applying for the position "Frontend Web Developer â€“ Neurorobotics".
